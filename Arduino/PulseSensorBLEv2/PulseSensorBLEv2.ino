  HeartRateBLE.ino
  Written by Federico Sanna
  This example demonstrates the use of the Serial Plotter (Tools->Serial Plotter) to display the heart beats and
  how to send to a smarthphone via BLE information on the heart rate according to bluetooth standards.
  To diplay the heart rate on the serial plotter the board has to be connected via bluetooth first.
  You can adjust the threshold value depending on who you are recording the value on to better capture the beats,
  and you can use the Nordic Toolbox App to receive the heart rate on your phone.
  The heart rate is calculated on values recorded every 10 milliseconds over an interval of 3 seconds, meaning that 
  the heart rate will be updated every 3 seconds.
  In this example BLE_LED shows the status of the board. It will blink every 200 ms when the board is scanning.
  It will be on when the board is connected to a peripheral. It will be off when the board is disconnected.
  This example code is in the public domain.
